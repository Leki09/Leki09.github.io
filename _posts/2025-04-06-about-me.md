# About Me

I completed my engineering degree in Instrumentation and am deeply passionate about technology and continuous learning. Currently, I work as an engineer at Bhutan Automation, where I apply my skills in automation and industrial systems.

Driven by curiosity and a desire to grow, I constantly seek new opportunities to expand my knowledge — whether it’s exploring emerging technologies, solving complex problems, or learning from real-world experiences. My goal is not just to excel in my field, but to contribute meaningfully to impactful projects that make a difference.

Learning isn't just a phase for me — it's a mindset I carry into everything I do.
